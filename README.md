The purpose of this program is to add texture to the simulation. The new program is re-written with C++ language.

The OpenGL structure is mainly based on Benny's tutorial : https://github.com/BennyQBD/ModernOpenGLTutorial

run the "celegans_simulator/compile.sh" from terminal to compile it.

run "celegans_simulator/celegans" to play.

type many time of "a" "f" "n" "p" to trigger the movement. click the window quit button to exit.

------------------------------

A fancy way of usage is to broadcast the GUI to a smartphone (tested with iphoneX) by "x11vnc -viewonly" command.
The screen of the smartphone then can be used as a moving sample to do demo for Hawkvision tracking system.
